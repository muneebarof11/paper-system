That left-over shaft is not shown.\n//    Instead, it is sliced off because the span's CSS has overflow: hidden.\n//    Thus, the reader sees an arrow that matches the subject matter width\n//    without distortion.\n//    Some functions, such as \\cancel, need to vary their aspect ratio. These\n//    functions do not get the overflow SVG treatment.\n// Second Brush Stroke\n//    Low resolution monitors struggle to display images in fine detail.\n//    So browsers apply anti-aliasing. A long straight arrow shaft therefore\n//    will sometimes appear as if it has a blurred edge.\n//    To mitigate this, these SVG files contain a second \"brush-stroke\" on the\n//    arrow shafts. That is, a second long thin rectangular SVG path has been\n//    written directly on top of each arrow shaft. This reinforcement causes\n//    some of the screen pixels to display as black instead of the anti-aliased\n//    gray pixel that a  single path would generate. So we get arrow shafts\n//    whose edges appear to be sharper.\n// In the katexImagesData object just below, the dimensions all\n// correspond to path geometry inside the relevant SVG.\n// For example, \\overrightarrow uses the same arrowhead as glyph U+2192\n// from the KaTeX Main font. The scaling factor is 1000.\n// That is, inside the font, that arrowhead is 522 units tall, which\n// corresponds to 0.522 em inside the document.\n\n\nvar katexImagesData = {\n  //   path(s), minWidth, height, align\n  overrightarrow: [[\"rightarrow\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  overleftarrow: [[\"leftarrow\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  underrightarrow: [[\"rightarrow\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  underleftarrow: [[\"leftarrow\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  xrightarrow: [[\"rightarrow\"], 1.469, 522, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  xleftarrow: [[\"leftarrow\"], 1.469, 522, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  Overrightarrow: [[\"doublerightarrow\"], 0.888, 560, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  xRightarrow: [[\"doublerightarrow\"], 1.526, 560, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  xLeftarrow: [[\"doubleleftarrow\"], 1.526, 560, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  overleftharpoon: [[\"leftharpoon\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  xleftharpoonup: [[\"leftharpoon\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  xleftharpoondown: [[\"leftharpoondown\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  overrightharpoon: [[\"rightharpoon\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  xrightharpoonup: [[\"rightharpoon\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  xrightharpoondown: [[\"rightharpoondown\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  xlongequal: [[\"longequal\"], 0.888, 334, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  xtwoheadleftarrow: [[\"twoheadleftarrow\"], 0.888, 334, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  xtwoheadrightarrow: [[\"twoheadrightarrow\"], 0.888, 334, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  overleftrightarrow: [[\"leftarrow\", \"rightarrow\"], 0.888, 522],\n  overbrace: [[\"leftbrace\", \"midbrace\", \"rightbrace\"], 1.6, 548],\n  underbrace: [[\"leftbraceunder\", \"midbraceunder\", \"rightbraceunder\"], 1.6, 548],\n  underleftrightarrow: [[\"leftarrow\", \"rightarrow\"], 0.888, 522],\n  xleftrightarrow: [[\"leftarrow\", \"rightarrow\"], 1.75, 522],\n  xLeftrightarrow: [[\"doubleleftarrow\", \"doublerightarrow\"], 1.75, 560],\n  xrightleftharpoons: [[\"leftharpoondownplus\", \"rightharpoonplus\"], 1.75, 716],\n  xleftrightharpoons: [[\"leftharpoonplus\", \"rightharpoondownplus\"], 1.75, 716],\n  xhookleftarrow: [[\"leftarrow\", \"righthook\"], 1.08, 522],\n  xhookrightarrow: [[\"lefthook\", \"rightarrow\"], 1.08, 522],\n  overlinesegment: [[\"leftlinesegment\", \"rightlinesegment\"], 0.888, 522],\n  underlinesegment: [[\"leftlinesegment\", \"rightlinesegment\"], 0.888, 522],\n  overgroup: [[\"leftgroup\", \"rightgroup\"], 0.888, 342],\n  undergroup: [[\"leftgroupunder\", \"rightgroupunder\"], 0.888, 342],\n  xmapsto: [[\"leftmapsto\", \"rightarrow\"], 1.5, 522],\n  xtofrom: [[\"leftToFrom\", \"rightToFrom\"], 1.75, 528],\n  // The next three arrows are from the mhchem package.\n  // In mhchem.sty, min-length is 2.0em.

Since TeX isn't context-free, standard parsers don't work particularly\n * well.\n *\n * The strategy of this parser is as such:\n *\n * The main functions (the `.parse...` ones) take a position in the current\n * parse string to parse tokens from. The lexer (found in Lexer.js, stored at\n * this.gullet.lexer) also supports pulling out tokens at arbitrary places. When\n * individual tokens are needed at a position, the lexer is called to pull out a\n * token, which is then used.\n *\n * The parser has a property called \"mode\" indicating the mode that\n * the parser is currently in. Currently it has to be one of \"math\" or\n * \"text\", which denotes whether the current environment is a math-y\n * one or a text-y one (e.g. inside \\text). Currently, this serves to\n * limit the functions which can be used in text mode.\n *\n * The main functions then return an object which contains the useful data that\n * was parsed at its given point, and a new position at the end of the parsed\n * data. The main functions can call each other and continue the parsing by\n * using the returned position as a new starting point.\n *\n * There are also extra `.handle...` functions, which pull out some reused\n * functionality into self-contained functions.\n *\n * The functions return ParseNodes.\n */\nvar Parser_Parser =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction () {\n  function Parser(input, settings) {\n    this.mode = void 0;\n    this.gullet = void 0;\n    this.settings = void 0;\n    this.leftrightDepth = void 0;\n    this.nextToken = void 0;\n    // Start in math mode\n    this.mode = \"math\"; // Create a new macro expander (gullet) and (indirectly via that) also a\n    // new lexer (mouth) for this parser (stomach, in the language of TeX)\n\n    this.gullet = new MacroExpander_MacroExpander(input, settings, this.mode); // Store the settings for use in parsing\n\n    this.settings = settings; // Count leftright depth (for \\middle errors)\n\n    this.leftrightDepth = 0;\n  }\n  /**\n   * Checks a result to make sure it has the right type, and throws an\n   * appropriate error otherwise.\n   */\n\n\n  var _proto = Parser.prototype;\n\n  _proto.expect = function expect(text, consume) {\n    if (consume === void 0) {\n      consume = true;\n    }\n\n    if (this.nextToken.text !== text) {\n      throw new src_ParseError(\"Expected '\" + text + \"', got '\" + this.nextToken.text + \"'\", this.nextToken);\n    }\n\n    if (consume) {\n      this.consume();\n    }\n  }\n  /**\n   * Considers the current look ahead token as consumed,\n   * and fetches the one after that as the new look ahead.\n   */\n  ;\n\n  _proto.consume = function consume() {\n    this.nextToken = this.gullet.expandNextToken();\n  }\n  /**\n   * Switches between \"text\" and \"math\" modes.\n   */\n  ;\n\n  _proto.switchMode = function switchMode(newMode) {\n    this.mode = newMode;\n    this.gullet.switchMode(newMode);\n  }\n  /**\n   * Main parsing function, which parses an entire input.\n   */\n  ;\n\n  _proto.parse = function parse() {\n    // Create a group namespace for the math expression.\n    // (LaTeX creates a new group for every $...$, $$...$$, \\[...\\].)\n    this.gullet.beginGroup(); // Use old \\color behavior (same as LaTeX's \\textcolor) if requested.\n    // We do this within the group for the math expression, so it doesn't\n    // pollute settings.macros.\n\n    if (this.settings.colorIsTextColor) {\n      this.gullet.macros.set(\"\\\\color\", \"\\\\textcolor\");\n    } // Try to parse the input\n\n\n    this.consume();\n    var parse = this.parseExpression(false); // If we succeeded, make sure there's an EOF at the end\n\n    this.expect(\"EOF\", false); // End the group namespace for the expression\n\n    this.gullet.endGroup();\n    return parse;\n  };\n\n  _proto.parseExpression = function parseExpression(breakOnInfix, breakOnTokenText) {\n    var body = []; // Keep adding atoms to the body until we can't parse any more atoms (either\n    // we reached the end, a }, or a \\right)\n\n    while (true) {\n      // Ignore spaces in math mode\n      if (this.mode === \"math\") {\n        this.consumeSpaces();\n      }\n\n      var lex = this.nextToken;\n\n      if (Parser.endOfExpression.indexOf(lex.text) !== -1) {\n        break;\n      }\n\n      if (breakOnTokenText && lex.text === breakOnTokenText) {\n        break;\n      }\n\n      if (breakOnInfix && src_functions[lex.text] && src_functions[lex.text].infix) {\n        break;\n      }\n\n      var atom = this.parseAtom(breakOnTokenText);\n\n      if (!atom) {\n        break;\n      }\n\n      body.push(atom);\n    }\n\n    if (this.mode === \"text\") {\n      this.formLigatures(body);\n    }\n\n    return this.handleInfixNodes(body);\n  }\n  /**\n   * Rewrites infix operators such as \\over with corresponding commands such\n   * as \\frac.\n   *\n   * There can only be one infix operator per group.
